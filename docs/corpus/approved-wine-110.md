# Approved-Wine Corpus Acquisition (110 screenshots)

This document records a **bounded corpus-acquisition slice**: 110 author-provided
screenshots of previously approved wine-label artwork, ingested into the fixture
corpus as governed **inventory**. It is provenance and identity only.

- **No expected-answer annotations** exist yet (no brand, alcohol, varietal,
  appellation, vintage, net-contents, or domestic/imported facts).
- **No representative-accuracy claim** is made; this is not a measurement
  baseline (see issue #15).
- **No OCR tuning, production-extraction, rule, or parser change** is in this
  slice.
- **No mandatory 110-image OCR run** in CI — every record is disabled from
  real-OCR regression, awaiting annotation and an evaluation-split assignment.

## Composition

- **110 independent approved-label screenshots**, one per fixture directory
  `tests/fixtures/precheck/approved-wine-NNN/`.
- **55 red** (`approved-wine-001`–`approved-wine-055`) and **55 white**
  (`approved-wine-056`–`approved-wine-110`), per author classification.
- Mixed source formats preserved byte-for-byte: **82 JPEG, 28 PNG**. The
  committed filename keeps the true extension (`label.jpeg` or `label.png`).

## Provenance

The corpus claims **only** the following about each record:

> Author-provided public-registry screenshot or downloaded display derivative of
> previously approved wine-label artwork. The delivered PNG/JPEG format may
> differ from the original applicant-submitted format.

Additionally: original external source bytes and public-record metadata were not
retained in this ingestion step, and approval status is author-reported and has
**not** been independently reverified by the ingestion script.

### Four distinct things (do not conflate)

1. **Approved label record** — the fact, in the public registry, that a label
   was approved. This is what "previously approved" refers to; it is
   author-reported here and not independently reverified.
2. **Public-registry screenshot / downloaded display derivative** — what is
   actually committed: a rendered/displayed representation captured or downloaded
   by the author. This is the artifact in the repository.
3. **Original applicant-submitted file** — the file the applicant uploaded during
   the application. It is **not** in this repository, and its format is unknown.
   The delivered PNG/JPEG format here may differ from it. In particular, a
   committed PNG is **not** evidence that PNG was an accepted applicant upload
   format.
4. **Original government-hosted source asset** — the exact bytes the registry
   stores. Not retained here; no per-asset URL, digest, or resolution is claimed.

The corpus does **not** claim the committed image is the original designer
artwork, the original applicant-submitted file, the original government-hosted
asset, original resolution, domestic origin, a specific TTB identifier, or
representativeness of all wine labels. `sourceAuthority` is
`author-provided-local-acquisition`; `publicRecordId` is `null`.

## Screenshot/display-derivative vs. source vs. synthetic

- **Candidate (this slice):** an independent, previously approved label as a
  public-registry screenshot or downloaded display derivative —
  `sourceStratum: approved_artwork_screenshot`,
  `independence: independent_real_label`. Not the applicant file and not the
  government-hosted source asset.
- **Source asset / derivative** (M Cellars): a screened crop of a public record
  and its deterministic derivative.
- **Synthetic** (existing): constructed OCR token lines, no image.

## Reproducible ingestion

`scripts/fixtures/ingest-approved-wine.mjs` enumerates `wine label <n>.(jpeg|jpg|png)`
for n = 1..110 in `~/Downloads` (numeric suffix is **not** part of fixture
identity), validates signature/dimensions/non-emptiness, copies each file
byte-for-byte, runs a bounded automated privacy metadata scan (no OCR), and
writes the inventory and the 110 candidate corpus-index entries.

Verify identities: `npx vitest run src/fixtures/approved-wine-ingest.test.ts`.

## Truth-label boundary

Every candidate carries the unaltered truth-label prohibition and `expectations:
null`. Production code never imports the corpus index or the inventory
(`src/fixtures/truth-boundary.test.ts`). Any future expected values reach only
downstream rules through the declared-facts contract — never the extractor.

## Correction: all 110 are single-label examples

**All 110 approved-wine records are single-label examples.** There are **no
multi-artifact (front/back or divided-information) records inside the 110**. An
earlier review-queue item assumed ~10 of the 110 were multi-panel; that
assumption was incorrect and is now obsolete (see the review queue for the
corrected note and the historical reason it existed). The `multiPanelStatus`
field on these records therefore stays `unmapped` and is **not applicable** to
the single-label benchmark.

The 10 genuine wine multi-artifact screenshots are a **separate challenge
corpus** (`wine-multi-artifact-01..10`), not part of these 110. See
[`supplemental-challenge-and-sentinels.md`](supplemental-challenge-and-sentinels.md).

## Awaiting a later bounded slice

- **Second-pass annotation**: assign per-record expected brand/alcohol
  observation states and required tokens (no answers are invented here).
- **Split assignment**: `development` / `validation` / `holdout`
  (`splitStatus` is currently `unassigned` for all 110).
- **Decimal-comma mapping**: some labels use `13,0` instead of `13.0`; exact
  fixture ids are not yet supplied (`decimalCommaStatus: unmapped`). No parser
  change and no expected alcohol values are added here.
- **Non-wine sentinels**: non-wine samples are **not** part of this 110; the
  agave-spirit, ale, and single-malt-whiskey category sentinels are governed
  separately in
  [`supplemental-challenge-and-sentinels.md`](supplemental-challenge-and-sentinels.md).

## Privacy screening

An automated byte/metadata scan (embedded email/phone-like strings) ran during
ingestion; 0 files were quarantined. Pixel-level visual screening relies on the
author's attestation that these are approved-label artwork and is flagged for
second-pass review (`privacyReviewStatus:
screenshot-metadata-screened-author-attested`). No OCR dump was generated or
committed as screening evidence.
